# API testing setup

## Stateful sandbox
To help with API testing, a "stateful sandbox" environment has been created to mirror the production environment. 

The tester should start by creating a [test user](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0). The test user response will return a username, password and a *Pillar 2 ID*. The Pillar 2 ID must be included in the header of each test request, or an error will be returned. 

The next step is to create a test organisation using the *Create Test Organisation* endpoint. The test organisation can be used for the duration of testing, and should be deleted once a test scenario is completed. If the tester does not delete the organisation, it will be deleted within 28 days. 

If required, the tester can also create a simulation of a GloBE Information Return (**GIR**) using the *Create a Test GloBE Information Return* endpoint.

## Test organisation

The test organisation facilitates the storage of submissions against a specific accounting period. This data is then used to fulfill any GET requests made on the API by the *Obligations and Submissions* endpoint.

The cURL examples shown here will create a UK only test organisation where *domesticOnly* is set to true for a specific accounting period.

The *domesticOnly* flag is used to create an MNE or UK-only organisation. This will be important when testing the *SubmitUKTR* endpoint and the conditional flags which depend on this value.


```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url http://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/organisations/pillar-two/setup/organisation \
  --header 'accept: application/vnd.hmrc.1.0+json' \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer {{bearer_token}}' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-pillar2-id: {{pillar2Id}} \
  --data '{
  "orgDetails": {
    "domesticOnly": true,
    "organisationName": "Test Organisation Ltd",
    "registrationDate": "2025-03-01"
  },
  "accountingPeriod": {
    "startDate": "2024-01-01",
    "endDate": "2024-12-31"
  }
}'
```

## GloBE information return

**Important**: Creating a GIR simulation in the test environment is for testing purposes only, and does not reflect the process for submitting an entityâ€™s GIR to comply with Pillar 2.

Once the test organisation has been created, a simulation of a GIR can be created in the sandbox to help support testing the <em>Retrieve Obligations and Submissions</em> endpoint. The request is submitted using the dates for the specified accounting period.

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/organisations/pillar-two/setup/globe-information-return \
  --header 'accept: application/vnd.hmrc.1.0+json' \
  --header 'authorization: {{bearer_token}}' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-pillar2-id: {{testPlrId}}' \
  --data '{
  "accountingPeriodFrom": "2024-01-01",
  "accountingPeriodTo": "2024-12-31"
}'
```

A successful response will return a processing date.

```json
{
  "processingDate": "2025-05-22T09:26:17Z"
}
```

When an *Obligations and Submissions* GET request is submitted, the response will display a "GIR" *submissionType* under the "GIR" *obligationType*.

```json
{
  "processingDate": "2025-07-04T09:12:09Z",
  "accountingPeriodDetails": [
    {
      "startDate": "2024-01-01",
      "endDate": "2024-12-31",
      "dueDate": "2025-07-01",
      "underEnquiry": false,
      "obligations": [
        {
          "obligationType": "UKTR",
          "status": "Open",
          "canAmend": true,
          "submissions": []
        },
        {
          "obligationType": "GIR",
          "status": "Fulfilled",
          "canAmend": true,
          "submissions": [
            {
              "submissionType": "GIR",
              "receivedDate": "2025-07-04T09:12:05Z"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}     
```
