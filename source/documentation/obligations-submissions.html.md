# Retrieve obligations and submissions 

## Overview

Pillar 2 information can be organised into *obligations* and *submissions* for each accounting period. There are currently two submission types which can be retrieved using the API (UKTR, BTN) with another two planned (ORN, GIR). The *Retrieve Obligations and Submissions* endpoint has an HTTP GET code, so it is only ever used to retrieve information on an entityâ€™s obligations, the submissions required to meet these obligations and the due date for each obligation.

Obligations are instructions defined by HMRC for each entity. The first obligation relates to submitting a UKTR or BTN. The entity uses the API request to send information (a submission) to HMRC. Multiple submissions can be sent to fulfill an obligation within an accounting period, where a UKTR (or BTN) can be submitted. 

The *Retrieve Obligations and Submissions* response will return a maximum of ten submissions for each *obligationType*. If more than ten submissions have been sent within the requested date range, the ten most recent *submissionType* items will be returned.

## Testing

Before using the sandbox, please read through the "Test API Setup" page of the service guide and work through all the required steps for creating a test user and organisation. 

### Retrieve obligations and submissions 

The diagram below shows a *Retrieve Obligations and Submissions* request and response.

A *Retrieve Obligations and Submissions* GET request returns information on the *submissionType*, *submissionDate*, and the status of the obligation ("Open" or "Fulfilled"). The accounting period is defined by the *startDate* and *endDate* parameters. Each obligation is returned as an *obligationType* with each *submissionType* held as a nested value. 

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/organisations/pillar-two/obligations-and-submissions?fromDate=2024-01-01&toDate=2024-12-31' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN' \
  --header 'X-Pillar2-Id: YOUR_PILLAR2_ID' \
  --header 'Accept: application/vnd.hmrc.1.0+json'
```

The response will return a list of submissions for all accounting periods that fall within the requested date range, with a maximum of ten *submissionType* items for each *obligationType*. This example shows one fulfilled "UKTR" *obligationType* for the accounting period specified in the request, and an open "GIR" *obligationtype*.

    }
