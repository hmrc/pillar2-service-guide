# Amend overseas return notification

## Overview

An Overseas Return Notification (**ORN**) is an annual notice sent to HMRC by a Multinational Enterprise (**MNE**). The ORN contains information on the jurisdiction where the entity’s GloBE Information Return (**GIR**) has been submitted. 

If the entity has already submitted an ORN and the return information changes, they (or their agent) can send a request using the *Amend Overseas Return Notification* endpoint. Multiple amendments can be submitted for the specified accounting period. 

## Testing

Before using the sandbox, please read through the "API Testing Setup" page of the service guide and work through all the required steps for creating a test user and organisation.

### Amend overseas return notification

The diagram below shows a request which successfully amends an ORN.

Before sending an amendment, the ORN status can be checked by sending a GET request using the *Retrieve Obligations and Submissions* endpoint.

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/organisations/pillar-two/obligations-and-submissions/2024-01-01/2024-12-31 \
  --header 'authorization: YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-pillar2-id: YOUR_PILLAR2_ID'
```

The response shows a *submissionType* “ORN_CREATE” under the “GIR” *obligationType*, which confirms an amendment can be sent. 

```json
{
  "processingDate": "2025-05-20T14:27:06Z",
  "accountingPeriodDetails": [
    {
      "startDate": "2024-01-01",
      "endDate": "2024-12-31",
      "dueDate": "2025-07-01",
      "underEnquiry": false,
      "obligations": [
        {
          "obligationType": "UKTR",
          "status": "Open",
          "canAmend": true,
          "submissions": []
        },
        {
          "obligationType": "GIR",
          "status": "Fulfilled",
          "canAmend": true,
          "submissions": [
            {
              "submissionType": "ORN_CREATE",
              "receivedDate": "2025-05-20T14:08:41Z",
              "country": "US"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The *Amend Overseas Return Notification* request should include the Tax Identification Number (**TIN**) and issuing country for the GIR, as well as the accounting period and the date and location for the GIR. 
 
All fields in the request are mandatory.  

```shell
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/organisations/pillar-two/overseas-return-notification/amend \
  --header 'authorization: YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-pillar2-id: YOUR_PILLAR2_ID' \
  --data '{
  "accountingPeriodFrom": "2024-01-01",
  "accountingPeriodTo": "2024-12-31",
  "filedDateGIR": "2025-01-10",
  "countryGIR": "US",
  "reportingEntityName": "Newco PLC",
  "TIN": "US12345678",
  "issuingCountryTIN": "US"
}'
```
A successful response will include a *processingDate* and *formBundleNumber*. 

```json
{
  "processingDate": "2025-05-20T12:59:44Z",
  "formBundleNumber": "828631306613"
}
```

Following the amendment, an “ORN_AMEND” *submissionType* will be returned in the response generated by the *Retrieve Obligations and Submissions* endpoint. There are now two "ORN" *submissionType* entries for the same accounting period - one for “ORN_CREATE” and one for “ORN_AMEND”.

```json
{
  "processingDate": "2025-05-20T14:27:06Z",
  "accountingPeriodDetails": [
    {
      "startDate": "2024-01-01",
      "endDate": "2024-12-31",
      "dueDate": "2025-07-01",
      "underEnquiry": false,
      "obligations": [
        {
          "obligationType": "UKTR",
          "status": "Open",
          "canAmend": true,
          "submissions": []
        },
        {
          "obligationType": "GIR",
          "status": "Fulfilled",
          "canAmend": true,
          "submissions": [
            {
              "submissionType": "ORN_AMEND",
              "receivedDate": "2025-05-20T14:26:46Z",
              "country": "US"
            },
            {
              "submissionType": "ORN_CREATE",
              "receivedDate": "2025-05-20T14:08:41Z",
              "country": "US"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
