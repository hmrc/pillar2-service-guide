Overview

An Overseas Return Notification (ORN) is an annual notice sent to HMRC by a Multinational Enterprise (MNE). The ORN contains information on the jurisdiction where the entity’s GloBE Information Return (GIR) has been submitted. 

If the entity has already submitted an ORN and the return information changes, they (or their agent) can send a request using the Amend Overseas Return Notification endpoint. Multiple amendments can be submitted for the specified accounting period.

Amend overseas return notification


The diagram below shows a request which successfully amends an ORN. 





Before sending an amendment, the ORN status can be checked by sending a GET request using the Obligations and Submissions endpoint.


curl --request GET \
  --url https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/organisations/pillar-two/obligations-and-submissions/2024-01-01/2024-12-31 \
  --header 'authorization: YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-pillar2-id: YOUR_PILLAR2_ID'


The response shows a submissionType “ORN_CREATE” under the “GIR” obligationType, which confirms an amendment can be sent.

  "accountingPeriodDetails": [
    {
      "startDate": "2024-01-01",
      "endDate": "2024-12-31",
      "dueDate": "2025-07-01",
      "underEnquiry": false,
      "obligations": [
        {
          "obligationType": "UKTR",
          "status": "Open",
          "canAmend": true,
          "submissions": []
        },
        {
          "obligationType": "GIR",
          "status": "Fulfilled",
          "canAmend": true,
          "submissions": [

              "country": "US"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

The Amend Overseas Return Notification request should include the Tax Identification Number (TIN) and issuing country for the GIR, as well as the accounting period and the date and location for the GIR. 
 
All fields in the request are mandatory.  


curl --request PUT \
  --url https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/organisations/pillar-two/overseas-return-notification/amend \
  --header 'authorization: YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-pillar2-id: YOUR_PILLAR2_ID' \
  --data '{
  "accountingPeriodFrom": "2024-01-01",
  "accountingPeriodTo": "2024-12-31",
  "filedDateGIR": "2025-01-10",
  "countryGIR": "US",
  "reportingEntityName": "Newco PLC",
  "TIN": "US12345678",
  "issuingCountryTIN": "US"
}'






 A successful response will include a processingDate and formBundleNumber. 


{
  "processingDate": "2025-05-20T12:59:44Z",
  "formBundleNumber": "828631306613"
}


Following the amendment, an “ORN_AMEND” submissionType will be returned in the response generated by the Obligations and Submissions endpoint. There are now two "ORN" submissionType entries for the same accounting period - one for “ORN_CREATE” and one for “ORN_AMEND”.
